# AirBnB_clone

## Description

hbnb is a full clone of the web application AirBnB. This clone will be constructed in five phases. Currently, we have completed the first phase - to build a simple command interpreter that parses and evaluates input from the commandline appropriately. Test suite included. Future steps to come.

## Purpose

The purpose of the AirBnb project is to:
Markup : * create a parent class BaseModel that will take care of initializatio$
         * create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: instance <-> $
         * create all classes used for AirBnb that inherit from BaseModel
         * create an abstracted storage engine (FileStorage)
         * create unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
         * create a command interpreter that can do the following:
                * create a new object
                * retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
                * do operations on objects
                * update attributes of an object
                * destroy an object
         * learn how to do the following:
                * create a Python package
                * create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
                * implement Unit testing on a large project
                * serialize and deserialize a class
                * write and read a JSON file
                * manage datetime
                * create UUIDs
                * use *args and **kwargs
                * handle named arguments in a function
